> R functionalities for ChemSpider's new API services

ChemSpider has introduced a new API syntax in late 2018. `chemspideR` provides R wrappers around the new API services.

The aim of this package is to:

1.  Translate the new ChemSpider API services into R-friendly functions
2.  Include thorough quality checking *before* the query is send, to avoid using up the query quota because of, e.g., spelling errors
3.  Create the R functionality in a way that is suitable for both `base` and `tidyverse` programming
4.  Provide (non-ChemSpider) convenience functions to complement the functionality

The `chemspideR` package is platform independent, but requires a valid ChemSpider API key. While the `chemspideR` package does *not* provide any tools to securely store and access the API key, a look into the excellent [`keyring`](https://github.com/r-lib/keyring) package is recommended. Future updates of `chemspideR` will likely incorporate [`memoise`](https://github.com/r-lib/memoise) features to better handle query IDs.

Installation
------------

### Dependencies

This packages relies on two essential dependencies, namely `curl` and `jsonlite`. Additional (but not crucial) functionality for handling images is coming from the `png` package.

If not already installed, these packages *should* be installed automatically when installing `chemspideR`. Should this result in trouble, the dependency packages can be installed manually:

``` r
install.packages(c("curl", "jsonlite"))
# install.packages("png")
```

If `httr` and/or `jsonlite` are missing from the R library, all functions of `chemspider` will throw an error.

### R package

Install the package from GitHub (using `devtools`):

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("NIVANorge/chemspideR")
```

Currently the only tested environment for `chemspideR` is Windows 10, but it *should* install smoothly on macOS and Linux distributions as well. Please open an issue if you run into any troubles.
